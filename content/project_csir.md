# Research Project: Client-Side Information Retrieval

## Overview

In this research project, we develop technologies that employ client-side AI running on researchers’ PCs to continuously monitor research activities and information-seeking behaviors, autonomously retrieving and providing information necessary for advancing research. This approach reduces privacy and security risks while enabling the timely delivery of information that researchers intend to search for, information they did not explicitly intend to search for but is still useful, and information that contributes to the progress of their research.
